Hello

Welcome to GIT Output

In Git, vi output.txt doesn't have any special meaning inherently tied to Git itself. vi is a text editor commonly available in Unix-like operating systems, and output.txt would simply be a file you're editing using vi. However, in the context of Git, if you encounter vi output.txt, it likely means that Git is invoking the vi editor to display or edit the contents of the output.txt file.

Here's how it might happen:

Viewing a Diff:
When you use commands like git diff to view the changes between different versions of files, Git might display the differences in vi for easier reading and navigation.

Resolving Merge Conflicts:
If you're resolving merge conflicts in Git, and Git encounters conflicts in the output.txt file, it might open vi to allow you to manually resolve the conflicts.

Commit Message:
When you're writing a commit message, if you haven't specified a specific editor in your Git configuration, Git might default to using vi to allow you to write the commit message.
